                <p class="brief-info">
                    The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an 1876 novel by Mark Twain about a boy growing up along the
                    Mississippi River. It is set in the 1840s in the town of St. Petersburg, which is based on Hannibal,
                    Missouri, where Twain lived as a boy.
                    In the novel, Tom Sawyer has several adventures, often with his friend Huckleberry Finn. Originally
                    a commercial failure, the book ended up being the best selling of Twain's works during his lifetime.
                    Though overshadowed by its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the book is considered by many to
                    be a masterpiece of American literature.[5] It was one of the first novels to be written on a
                    typewriter.

                <p class="brief-summary">
                    An imaginative and mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother,
                    Sid, in the Mississippi River town of St. Petersburg, Missouri.
                    After playing hooky from school on Friday and dirtying his clothes in a fight, Tom is made to
                    whitewash the fence as punishment on Saturday.
                    At first, Tom is disappointed by having to forfeit his day off. However, he soon cleverly persuades
                    his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work.
                    He trades these treasures for tickets given out in Sunday school for memorizing Bible verses and
                    uses the tickets to claim a Bible as a prize.
                    He loses much of his glory, however, when, in response to a question to show off his knowledge, he
                    incorrectly answers that the first two disciples were David and Goliath.
